        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>There was an idea to create a ruined city after a disaster where the player, having exited the subway, must find a way to the police station.
There were the following tasks:
1. Show the player from the start the final goal.
2. Make several different indoor and outdoor spaces, but similar in theme.
3. Do not produce multiple passage options. There are only 1 fork in open space and 1 in closed space on the map</p>
